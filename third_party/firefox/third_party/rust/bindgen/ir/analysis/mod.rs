//! Fix-point analyses on the IR using the "monotone framework".
//!
//! A lattice is a set with a partial ordering between elements, where there is
//! a single least upper bound and a single greatest least bound for every
//! subset. We are dealing with finite lattices, which means that it has a
//! finite number of elements, and it follows that there exists a single top and
//! a single bottom member of the lattice. For example, the power set of a
//! finite set forms a finite lattice where partial ordering is defined by set
//! inclusion, that is `a <= b` if `a` is a subset of `b`. Here is the finite
//! lattice constructed from the set {0,1,2}:
//!
//! ```text
//!                    .----- Top = {0,1,2} -----.
//!                   /            |              \
//!                  /             |               \
//!                 /              |                \
//!              {0,1} -------.  {0,2}  .--------- {1,2}
//!                |           \ /   \ /             |
//!                |            /     \              |
//!                |           / \   / \             |
//!               {0} --------'   {1}   `---------- {2}
//!                 \              |                /
//!                  \             |               /
//!                   \            |              /
//!                    `------ Bottom = {} ------'
//! ```
//!
//! A monotone function `f` is a function where if `x <= y`, then it holds that
//! `f(x) <= f(y)`. It should be clear that running a monotone function to a
//! fix-point on a finite lattice will always terminate: `f` can only "move"
//! along the lattice in a single direction, and therefore can only either find
//! a fix-point in the middle of the lattice or continue to the top or bottom
//! depending if it is ascending or descending the lattice respectively.
//!
//! For a deeper introduction to the general form of this kind of analysis, see
//! [Static Program Analysis by Anders Møller and Michael I. Schwartzbach][spa].
