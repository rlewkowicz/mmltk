use crate::raw_mutex::RawMutex;

/// A mutual exclusion primitive useful for protecting shared data
///
/// This mutex will block threads waiting for the lock to become available. The
/// mutex can be statically initialized or created by the `new`
/// constructor. Each mutex has a type parameter which represents the data that
/// it is protecting. The data can only be accessed through the RAII guards
/// returned from `lock` and `try_lock`, which guarantees that the data is only
/// ever accessed when the mutex is locked.
///
/// # Fairness
///
/// A typical unfair lock can often end up in a situation where a single thread
/// quickly acquires and releases the same mutex in succession, which can starve
/// other threads waiting to acquire the mutex. While this improves throughput
/// because it doesn't force a context switch when a thread tries to re-acquire
/// a mutex it has just released, this can starve other threads.
///
/// This mutex uses [eventual fairness](https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/203350)
/// to ensure that the lock will be fair on average without sacrificing
/// throughput. This is done by forcing a fair unlock on average every 0.5ms,
/// which will force the lock to go to the next thread waiting for the mutex.
///
/// Additionally, any critical section longer than 1ms will always use a fair
/// unlock, which has a negligible impact on throughput considering the length
/// of the critical section.
///
/// You can also force a fair unlock by calling `MutexGuard::unlock_fair` when
/// unlocking a mutex instead of simply dropping the `MutexGuard`.
///
/// # Differences from the standard library `Mutex`
///
/// - No poisoning, the lock is released normally on panic.
/// - Only requires 1 byte of space, whereas the standard library boxes the
///   `Mutex` due to platform limitations.
/// - Can be statically constructed.
/// - Does not require any drop glue when dropped.
/// - Inline fast path for the uncontended case.
/// - Efficient handling of micro-contention using adaptive spinning.
/// - Allows raw locking & unlocking without a guard.
/// - Supports eventual fairness so that the mutex is fair on average.
/// - Optionally allows making the mutex fair by calling `MutexGuard::unlock_fair`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use parking_lot::Mutex;
/// use std::sync::{Arc, mpsc::channel};
/// use std::thread;
///
/// const N: usize = 10;
///
/// // Spawn a few threads to increment a shared variable (non-atomically), and
/// // let the main thread know once all increments are done.
/// //
/// // Here we're using an Arc to share memory among threads, and the data inside
/// // the Arc is protected with a mutex.
/// let data = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
///
/// let (tx, rx) = channel();
/// for _ in 0..10 {
///     let (data, tx) = (Arc::clone(&data), tx.clone());
///     thread::spawn(move || {
///         // The shared state can only be accessed once the lock is held.
///         // Our non-atomic increment is safe because we're the only thread
///         // which can access the shared state when the lock is held.
///         let mut data = data.lock();
///         *data += 1;
///         if *data == N {
///             tx.send(()).unwrap();
///         }
///         // the lock is unlocked here when `data` goes out of scope.
///     });
/// }
///
/// rx.recv().unwrap();
/// ```
