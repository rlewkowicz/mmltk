/// A Condition Variable
///
/// Condition variables represent the ability to block a thread such that it
/// consumes no CPU time while waiting for an event to occur. Condition
/// variables are typically associated with a boolean predicate (a condition)
/// and a mutex. The predicate is always verified inside of the mutex before
/// determining that thread must block.
///
/// Note that this module places one additional restriction over the system
/// condition variables: each condvar can be used with only one mutex at a
/// time. Any attempt to use multiple mutexes on the same condition variable
/// simultaneously will result in a runtime panic. However it is possible to
/// switch to a different mutex if there are no threads currently waiting on
/// the condition variable.
///
/// # Differences from the standard library `Condvar`
///
/// - No spurious wakeups: A wait will only return a non-timeout result if it
///   was woken up by `notify_one` or `notify_all`.
/// - `Condvar::notify_all` will only wake up a single thread, the rest are
///   requeued to wait for the `Mutex` to be unlocked by the thread that was
///   woken up.
/// - Only requires 1 word of space, whereas the standard library boxes the
///   `Condvar` due to platform limitations.
/// - Can be statically constructed.
/// - Does not require any drop glue when dropped.
/// - Inline fast path for the uncontended case.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use parking_lot::{Mutex, Condvar};
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use std::thread;
///
/// let pair = Arc::new((Mutex::new(false), Condvar::new()));
/// let pair2 = pair.clone();
///
/// // Inside of our lock, spawn a new thread, and then wait for it to start
/// thread::spawn(move|| {
///     let &(ref lock, ref cvar) = &*pair2;
///     let mut started = lock.lock();
///     *started = true;
///     cvar.notify_one();
/// });
///
/// // wait for the thread to start up
/// let &(ref lock, ref cvar) = &*pair;
/// let mut started = lock.lock();
/// if !*started {
///     cvar.wait(&mut started);
/// }
/// // Note that we used an if instead of a while loop above. This is only
/// // possible because parking_lot's Condvar will never spuriously wake up.
/// // This means that wait() will only return after notify_one or notify_all is
/// // called.
