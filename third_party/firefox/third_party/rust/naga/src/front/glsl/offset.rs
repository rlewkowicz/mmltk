/*!
Module responsible for calculating the offset and span for types.

There exists two types of layouts std140 and std430 (there's technically
two more layouts, shared and packed. Shared is not supported by spirv. Packed is
implementation dependent and for now it's just implemented as an alias to
std140).

The OpenGl spec (the layout rules are defined by the OpenGl spec in section
7.6.2.2 as opposed to the GLSL spec) uses the term basic machine units which are
equivalent to bytes.
